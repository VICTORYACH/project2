`<h1>I AM ASPIRING SOFTWARE ENGINEER ACHUBA VICTORY</h1> 
  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <P
    class = "welcome">There have been a lot of changes in the last months. 
    My work as an employed Aprrentice software engineer kind of got to a new level because of the changes in my project. 
    I’m learning a whole lot in this project and am looking forward to learn even more. 
    My employer offers me great opportunities and my spare time projects and my mentoring also extend my horizon. 
    The regular meeting of developers, which I’m organizing, is a fun, informative and empowering event. 
    I’ve played with more technologies, architectures and systems than ever before.</P>
    <h3>MY MANTRA IS ...</h3>
  <p>"I am an engineer. I apply analytic thinking to problems and find a pragmatic solution that isn’t a quick fix, 
    but a lasting value."</p>
